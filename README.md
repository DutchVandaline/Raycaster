This project is a raycasting engine written in C and openGL, inspired by classic 3D games like <Wolfenstein> and <Doom>. Raycasting is a rendering technique to create a 3D perspective in a 2D map.

## Demo

Here's a quick look at what I'be built with C:

## Background
The White House urged that C/C++ is dangerous due to the garbage collection. So, they wanted to stop developing with C/C++. I had a Nostalgia and admiration on 1990s to 2000s developers. I decided to make a fps game using C and OpenGL.

## Features

- **Real-time rendering** of 2D maps into 3D projections.Of Course, IT'S 2D.
- **TPS** inspired by <Resident Evil 4>, I made Third Person Shooter with Over-the-shoulder cam.
